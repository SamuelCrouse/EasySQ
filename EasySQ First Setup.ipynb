    "# EasySQ Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through how to install EasySQ from the github onto your IDE.<br>\n",
    "If you are using PyCharm, follow the <i>PyCharm install guide.docx</i> located in the github repo. Otherwise, setup your IDE how you would like and then come back here.<br>\n",
    "Once you have setup your IDE and run a \"Hello World\" script to make sure things are working, you are now ready to begin EasySQ installation.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1 Getting from the GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to download the repo as a .zip and place the files into the project manually.<br>\n",
    "First, download the repo and unzip it.<br>\n",
    "Secondly, place the following files into your project:<br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><code>EasySQ.py</code></li>\n",
    "    <li><code>EasySQTools.py</code></li>\n",
    "    <li>Place the directory called <code>colors</code> into your project. This contains the color palettes for use in the demos. If you don't, you will need to make a directory and avoid using the provided palettes.</li>\n",
    "    <li><code>requirements.txt</code> PyCharm will recognize this and ask to import the required packages. If your IDE does not, or PyCharm does not, please install these manually.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time, I would also recommend:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><code>demo_1.py</code></li> for learning and working with EasySQ as it follows the Squidpy demos.\n",
    "    <li><code>demo_2.py</code></li>\n",
    "    <li><code>DisplayPalette.py</code></li> for showing the available color palettes.\n",
    "</ol>"

    "#### Step 2 Running the Demos. (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to EasySQ or Squidpy I would recommend looking through demos provided in the repo and by Squidpy. This will help things make sense when you try to make your own project.<br>\n",
    "Start with <code>EasySQ Demo 1.ipynb</code> and then do <code>EasySQ Demo 2.ipynb</code>. These follow the linked Squidpy demos.\n",
    "Once that is complete, I would recommend looking at the Squidpy Interface demo (once its completed), to see how to use EasySQ and Squidpy together."

    "\n",
    "Once you feel confident enough to create your own project, all you have to do is:<br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><code>import EasySQ as esq</code></li>\n",
    "    <li><code>if __name__ == \"__main__\":</code></li> EasySQ must be called from this if for some Squidpy functions to work.\n",
    "    <li><code>esqAn = esq.Analysis(data_path='path/to/my/data/')</code></li> create a new Analysis class object and provide it a path to the directory for your data.\n",
