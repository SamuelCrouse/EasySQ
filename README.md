# <b>EasySQ README.md</b>

### The purpose of EasySQ is to take a high level approach to Squidpy use.
<ul>
    <li>Get started with Squidpy in an easy to understand environment that can be easily translated into a more complex workflow.</li>
    <li>Abstract certain processes that are currently time consuming and complex in default Squidpy.</li>
    <li>Streamline and accelerate the process of outputing basic analysis.</li>
    <li>Work with more complex Squidpy processes through the use of both EasySQ and Squidpy.</li>
</ul>

### Demo 1 follows ["this"](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/tutorials/tutorial_vizgen.html) Squidpy tutorial on analyzing vizgen data.
I would recommend working through the provided "EasySQ Demo demo_number.ipynb." 1 and 2 are going to explain how to use EasySQ for your analysis of vizgen data.
There is also a demo on using EasySQ with Squidpy functions so that you can mix and match the two, which is also recommended.

### Demo 2 follows ["this"](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/tutorials/tutorial_vizgen_mouse_liver.html) Squidpy tutorial on analyzing vizgen data.

#### For more information regarding any of the functions used, see the corresponding [Squidpy documentation](https://squidpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#).
